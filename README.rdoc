Dealr

Dealr is the first full rails app that I worked on for General Assembly's Web Development Immersive course. The purpose of Dealr is to use external datasources to build a database of deals in the New York City area and provide those deals to users in a simple user interface. Thus, Dealr is a discount, deals, and coupon aggregator that allows users view all deals in their local area as specified by a user's zipcode. 

I start out by seeding a database with the most popular deals for that day, as provided by 8coupons.com via their API. After a user has signed up and logged in to their account, I render all of the deals in the main deals view. A user can click on a deal to see more information, link to the deal's provider website, or save that deal to their account to view later. 

Future updates will include search and filter functionality for deals as well as new data sources such as Sqoot and GroupOn.
